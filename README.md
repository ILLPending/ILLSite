# Impossible Level List Full-stack app
*Impossible Level List full stack repo for our favorite GD impossible level enjoyers*

# Introduction
I am MateussDev. You may know me for making Noclipped or building some levels in Geometry Dash, like Madness by me and sequoia
Here I decided to be more useful to the ILL community, so I started the development of the website version of the Impossible Level List

This list should be a simple excercise for making database-driven web apps similar to Pointercrate, but with my own twists and ticks

Progress coming soon! :)
