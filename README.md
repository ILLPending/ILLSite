# ILL Website

## Getting started

You'll need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to download packages. We're using it
instead of npm because it's way faster.

1. Run `pnpm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies
2. Run `pnpm dev` to run a local web server

## Backend developers

Most of the interesting stuff is located [over here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server).

> Whoever's in charge, please update this area and fill it in with the tech you're using. Thanks!

## Frontend developers

TODO! We don't need this section yet as we are waiting for the backend devs to do stuff.
